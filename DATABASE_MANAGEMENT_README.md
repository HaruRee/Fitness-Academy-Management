# Database Management System - README

## Overview
The Database Management System provides a secure, web-based interface for database backup and restore operations within the Fitness Academy admin dashboard.

## Features

### âœ… Backup System
- **One-click database backup** - Downloads complete SQL dump
- **Automatic file naming** with timestamp
- **Complete data export** including structure and data
- **Activity logging** for audit purposes
- **Error handling** with user-friendly messages

### âœ… Restore System
- **Drag & drop file upload** interface
- **File validation** (only .sql files accepted)
- **Transaction-based restore** (rollback on error)
- **Progress feedback** with success/error messages
- **Activity logging** for audit purposes

### âœ… Database Statistics
- **Table information** (rows, data size, index size)
- **Total database size** calculation
- **Performance insights** sorted by table size

## Security Features

### ðŸ”’ Access Control
- **Admin-only access** - Role-based authentication required
- **Session validation** - Prevents unauthorized access
- **Activity tracking** - All operations logged to audit trail

### ðŸ”’ Data Protection
- **Transaction safety** - Restore operations use database transactions
- **Foreign key handling** - Properly manages constraints during restore
- **File validation** - Only accepts .sql files
- **Error handling** - Graceful failure with detailed error messages

## Usage Instructions

### For Administrators:

1. **Access the System**
   - Navigate to Admin Dashboard
   - Click "Backup & Restore" in the sidebar under "Database" section

2. **Creating Backups**
   - Click "Download Backup" button
   - File will be automatically downloaded with timestamp
   - Backup includes all tables and data

3. **Restoring Database**
   - Click "Choose File" or drag .sql file to drop zone
   - Click "Upload & Restore" 
   - System will validate and restore the database
   - Success/error message will be displayed

### File Locations
- **Main Interface**: `includes/database_management.php`

## Configuration Files

### Secured Configuration
All sensitive data has been moved to secure configuration files:

- `config/database.php` - Database credentials (excluded from Git)
- `config/api_config.php` - API keys and SMTP settings (excluded from Git)
- `config/database.template.php` - Template for database configuration
- `config/api_config.template.php` - Template for API configuration

### .gitignore Protection
The following patterns are excluded from version control:
```
config/database.php
config/api_config.php
*.sql
*.bak
*.backup
*.PublishSettings
```

## Technical Implementation

### Technologies Used
- **PHP 7.4+** with PDO for database operations
- **MySQL/Azure MySQL** database
- **HTML5** with drag & drop file API
- **CSS3** with modern styling and responsive design
- **JavaScript** for interactive file upload experience

### Database Operations
- Uses **PDO prepared statements** for security
- Implements **transaction-based operations** for data integrity
- Handles **foreign key constraints** properly
- Includes **comprehensive error handling**

### File Handling
- **Server-side validation** of uploaded files
- **Secure file processing** with proper error handling
- **Memory-efficient** processing for large backup files
- **Clean up** of temporary files

## Testing

The database management system includes built-in error handling and validation.

**Note**: All test files have been removed from the production environment.

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
1. **Monitor backup file sizes** - Large databases may need chunked backups
2. **Test restore operations** periodically with non-production data
3. **Review audit logs** for backup/restore activities
4. **Update configuration templates** when adding new settings

### Troubleshooting
- **Permission errors**: Ensure web server has write access to backup directory
- **Memory limits**: Large databases may require PHP memory_limit adjustment
- **Connection timeouts**: Large operations may need max_execution_time increase
- **File upload limits**: Check PHP upload_max_filesize and post_max_size
